# Recti-Cure-Web-Application
 Hello everyone, 
 There is an eye disease named 'Cataract' caused due to the clouding of lens in eye. My project is to create a website source for people to self detect cataract disease instead of spending lots of hours in   
 hospital waiting halls,
 It is a web application for detection of cataract disease in eye.
 This application involves the integration of deep learning model named VGG-19 which is built on Convolutional neural network(CNN) architecture.
 This developed model is evaluated and deployed into the created website using Flask.
 This application involves many concepts like python libraries, deep learning and Machine learning for model deveopment, html, css, javascript, etc. for website development and , flask for deployment into website
# Features 
 User friendly Interface : simple and attractive web page for easy navigation.
 Image upload : supports uploading image into website for prediction of disease.
 Deep Learning Model: Includes the VGG-19 model trained for cataract detection.
 Real-Time Results: Provides quick predictions on the uploaded images.

# Requirements
 python 3 version
 Flask
 Tensorflow
 OpenCV
 NumPy
 Pandas
 Keras
 Matplotlib

#Working 
 Upload image : use interface to upload image of eye
 Analyze Image : VGG-19 model processes image and predict the presence of cataract
 View Results : receive real-time feedback.

#Project Structure
 app.py contains the flask code that responsible for loading the model and passing the uploaded image to the model for prediction.
 static folder for files like css and javascript  for website design 
 templates folder has the html files related to website includes index.html, service.html, about.html, contact.html
